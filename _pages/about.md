I am a Junior Fellow at the [Harvard Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about) and an ITC Fellow at the [Institute for Theory and Computation](https://itc.cfa.harvard.edu/) at Harvard College Observatory. I am interested in improving our understanding of binary evolution in order to uncover the formation mechanisms of gravitational wave sources. In addition to gravitational wave sources, I am excited about using electromagnetic sources, such as explosive deaths of massive stars, to gain a better understanding of the different phases of massive star evolution in a binary system.  

I earned my PhD in Astronomy from Northwestern University where I was a [Ford Foundation Pre-doctoral Fellow](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/2019/06/21/monica-gallegos-garcia-wins-ford-foundation-fellowship/) and [Northwestern Presidential Fellow](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/fellowships-and-grants/internal-fellowships-grants/presidential-fellowship-winners/) working under the guidance of Professor Vicky Kalogera.

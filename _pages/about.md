I am a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and an ITC Fellow at the Institute for Theory and Computation at Harvard College Observatory. I am interested in improving our understanding of binary evolution in order to uncover the formation mechanisms of gravitational wave sources. In addition to gravitational wave sources, I am excited about using electromagnetic sources, such as explosive deaths of massive stars, to gain a better understanding of the different phases of massive star evolution in a binary system.

I am currently a Junior Fellow at the [Harvard Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about) and an ITC Fellow at the [Institute for Theory and Computation](https://itc.cfa.harvard.edu/) at Harvard College Observatory. My research focuses on advancing our understanding of binary star evolution and uncovering the formation mechanisms behind the energetic transients in the Universe that are formed from the intricate interplay of stellar and binary evolution. 

To achieve this, I use a variety of methods to develop and test models of critical phases in binary evolution. Utilizing detailed MESA simulations and the [POSYDON](https://posydon.org/) population synthesis code, I am particularly interested in combining information from both electromagnetic and gravitational wave sources to form a comprehensive understanding of the formation pathways of energetic transients, from the diverse array of supernovae to compact object mergers.

I earned my PhD in Astronomy from Northwestern University, where I was a [Ford Foundation Pre-doctoral Fellow](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/2019/06/21/monica-gallegos-garcia-wins-ford-foundation-fellowship/) and [Northwestern Presidential Fellow](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/fellowships-and-grants/internal-fellowships-grants/presidential-fellowship-winners/).
